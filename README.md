# Roll-a-Ball-2-Game
A game I created for CS 199-GAM. 
---------------
Instructions:
Collect all of the boxes to win! Some boxes are hidden, others you want to avoid. 
Use the arrow keys to move around.

Blue squares = increases the player's speed
Orange squares = teleports the player back to home
Purple squares = increases the player's size
Red boxes = prevents the player from moving (ie GAME OVER)
Yellow boxes = what you want to collect
